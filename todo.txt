Setup Github repo -> Maik
Task 1:  Are the results for USA transferable to Germany?
    - Read Germany demographics     
    - Run Simulation with Germany and compare to USA predictions       

Task 2: Application of Model to current situation
    - Find current vaccination levels agedependent!  -> no data -> estimate?
    - implement as initial conditions       done
    - run simulations and find best strategy from now on

Task 3: Is the model capable of predicting Pandemic Evolution?
    - find R values from January to April
    - include in Simulation
    - run simulations and compare to results in the paper
    - How long do infected people stay infected
    - include dynamic numPerDay
    
    
optional:

    - task 1 with country with young age structure
